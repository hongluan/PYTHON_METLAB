# PYTHON_METLAB
This is the script especially for hydro-meteorologists who have to spend a lot of time on dealing with raw hydro-meteorological data. The script was designed to be user-interactive by which the program receives the inputs from users, and to be user-friendly by which users without high level of expert knowledges can easily calcultate and visualize the results. 
The script reads unformatted excel file as input. The users define number of header rows, number of maximum allowable no-null cells in a cell and number of columns needed. The script then helps format the data into usable data. Current version only helps handle one excel file with many sheets. In the next version, there will be options of dealing with many excel files or only one sheet of one excel file :)
